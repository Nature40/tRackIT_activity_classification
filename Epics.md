## Abstract 
The study of wildlife activity patterns provides insights into evolutionary adaptations, bioenergetics, foraging strategies, and physiological
responses to environmental cues. Activity patterns have been studied intensively and for a vast range of taxa with methods ranging from direct observations to displacement indices obtained from GPS-tags. However, there is a strong and methological determined bias towards larger taxa while most species inhabiting and shaping this planet are small. Existing technological solutions for activity data generation are either to large and heavy for most species (GPS, accelerometer) or require many hours of filedwork resulting in poor resolution data (manual VHF-telemetry). Kays et al 2011 proposed, that analysing the signal strength variation of autmatically detected VHF-signals enables the distinction between active and passive behaviour by a simple threshold. However, despite the promising possibilities offered by this technology, the studies applying the method are scarce. This may be partially explained by the expensive and customized technology the authors used. Recent developments allow a low-cost and open-source implementation of automatic radio-tracking. In this study we deployed an automatic radio-tracking system in a managed forest in mid Germany. XX Birds and XX Bats were equipped with vhf-tags and permanently recorded, resulting in 0.5-2 signals per second. In total the behaviour of xx Birds was observed in the field for xx hours resulting in xx hours of behavioural observaion. The behavior of xx bats was automatically observed by a system specially developed for this purpose (BatRack) and recordings were manually classified resulting in xx hours of behavioural observations. We will use the classified behavioural episodes to tune a machine learning classifier and will predict the behaviour of xx bats and xx birds. We calculated actograms and activity overlaps between individuals and species and investigate the influence of climatic factors on activity patterns.
